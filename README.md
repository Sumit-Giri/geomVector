# GeomVector Class
 
The GeomVector class represents a vector in three-dimensional space and provides various operations and calculations related to vectors.
 
## Features
 
- Construction of vectors with x, y, and z coordinates.
- Operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with other vectors.
- Scalar operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Calculation of magnitude, dot product, cross product, and angle between vectors.
- Projection of vectors onto other vectors.
- Calculation of the distance between vectors and planes.
